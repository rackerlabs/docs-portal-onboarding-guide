Reclaim VAT
===========

If you're a VAT-registered business or organization,
in most cases, you can reclaim
the value-added tax (VAT) that you pay when you
buy goods and services for your business. To
reclaim this money, you must have records to
support your claim. If you provide Rackspace
Technology with your
VAT ID number, Rackspace can
prepare an appropriate invoice for your records.

If you're not a VAT-registered business or organization,
you can't reclaim the VAT that you pay when you buy goods and services.
