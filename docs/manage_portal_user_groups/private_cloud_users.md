Note
:::

Deactivating a user only removes their access to MyRackspace. Access to
any devices under your account are not affected. The deactivated user
still receives ticket update emails and can call Rackspace for support.
If you need to delete a user on your account entirely, you can do so
from the user\'s details page. A deleted user cannot call Rackspace for
support or get any information about your account.
