title: Role-based access control
---

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a secure method of restricting
account access to authorized users. This method enables account owners
to add users and assign roles. Each role has specific permissions
defined by Rackspace Technology. RBAC enables users to perform actions
based on the scope of their assigned roles.

Account owners can create up to 100 users, each with their own password
and API key.
