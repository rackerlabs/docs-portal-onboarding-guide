You can manage your Rackspace Technology assets with an Application
Programmer Interface (API). Review [the catalog of Rackspace Technology
APIs](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/) for more information.

To begin using Rackspace APIs, you need your API key. Your API key is a
unique alphanumeric identifier associated with your account. You can use
it for universal authentication commands for all of your services.

When you reset your API key, any third-party applications are
disconnected until you set the new API key in your application. If you
are using your API key as a part of server code with a site or
application, the site or application also breaks. Update your API key
for any application to which you connected with the previous API key.
