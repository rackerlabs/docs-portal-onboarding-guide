# Create a new user

Use the following steps to create a new user:

1.  Log in to the [Rackspace Technology Customer
    Portal](https://login.rackspace.com).
2.  Select **Account \> User Management** from the global navigation
    menu.
3.  Select **Create New User**.
4.  Enter the new user information.
5.  Select **Create New User**.

If you are a Rackspace Technology Public Cloud customer, you can also
leverage user groups to manage your users and permissions. By grouping
users together and assigning permissions to the group, you can adjust
access for all users in the group at once, rather than adding or
revoking access permission for each user individually.
