This guide is intended for new Rackspace Technology customers who use
[the Rackspace Technology Customer

solutions, like ObjectRocket and Onica, have their own portals and do
not require access to [The Rackspace Technology Customer
Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/login). For more information about
these solutions, refer to the relevant documentation on the [Rackspace
Technology Support site](https://developer.rackspace.com/).
