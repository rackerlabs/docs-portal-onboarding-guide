title: Change your Cloud Account Owner
---

When a Primary User/Account Owner leaves the company or the name of the
company or project changes, then you need to change the Primary
User/Account Owner. To Update this information for your Rackspace
Technology Cloud and Amazon Web ServicesÂ® (AWS) accounts, Login to
[Rackspace Technology Customer Portal](https://login.rackspace.com).

**Note: Only the current Account Owner can assign a New Account Owner.**

**When you Change the Account Owner**:

-   You must select the new or promoted user from existing users on the
    account.
-   The selected user becomes the Primary Contact and has full control
    over the account.
-   As the former or demoted primary user, you are set up as an
    Administrative contact type and given basic [Role-Based Access
    Control (RBAC) Identity
    permissions](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-identity/v2/getting-started/).
    The primary user might need to set up RBAC permissions for the
    demoted user.

You can **Change the Account Owner** by using the following steps:

**Step 1** Log in to the [Rackspace Technology Customer
Portal](https://login.rackspace.com).

**Step 2** In the global navigation menu, click **Account** \>\>
