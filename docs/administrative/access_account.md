title: Get access to Account Switcher
---

The Account Switcher feature is available for only Fanatical Amazon Web
Services (FAWS) customers who use [Rackspace Technology Identity
Federation](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/rackspace-federation/) to
access their accounts.

Complete the following steps to gain access to the Account Switcher
feature:

1.  Contact your Customer Support Manager (CSM).

    Your CSM helps you determine if your account setup is a candidate
    for the Account Switcher beta.

2.  Complete the legal agreement document and attach it to a support
    ticket. This document requires information about the accounts you
    plan to link. You receive a notification after the account linking
    completes.

3.  Log in to the [Rackspace Technology Customer
    Portal](https://login.rackspace.com). Use the Account Switcher
    drop-down menu option to switch to delegate accounts.

    You can see ticketing information for only the account that you are
    currently accessing. Use the Account Switcher drop-down menu option
    to change to the account for which you want to view tickets.

    You always see notifications for your primary account. You do not
    see notifications for other principal or trusted accounts.
