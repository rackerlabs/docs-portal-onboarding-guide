This feature is currently in beta and is only available for Fanatical
Amazon Web Services (FAWS) customers who use [Rackspace Technology
Identity
Federation](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/rackspace-federation/) to
access their accounts.
:::

The Account Switcher feature simplifies the account management process
by making it easy to quickly switch which Rackspace account the user is
currently working within. Account Switcher helps large enterprise
customers with sprawling relationships and Federated Identity management
to streamline their workflow.

# Account linking

Account linking can occur after multiple accounts are linked together
through an agreement. In this model, you can grant users from a delegate
Rackspace account access to resources in a principal Rackspace account.
Members of the principal account can log into the [Rackspace Technology
Customer Portal](https://login.rackspace.com) and use the **Account
Linking** drop-down menu to navigate to connected delegate accounts.

Contact your Customer Support Manager to request access to Account
Switcher.
