Situation tickets
=================

In addition to manual tickets that you
and the Rackspace Technology support team generated, there are also
system-generated tickets, known as situation tickets.

Rackspace Technology uses artificial intelligence to
help streamline how your notifications work.
In this process, an AIOps integration maps
the event properties to the AIOps data fields
and identifies the source event as an AIOps event.
These events are grouped into a single alert
called a *situation*.
This technology collects events as raw data
and uses machine learning to group
them based on similarity into situation tickets.

AIOps groups events by using machine learning
algorithms, based on their similarities.

Alerts can be grouped or clustered in
several different ways, including:

- by arrival time

- by the time, text string, or description

- by a deterministic logic set up by your
  administrator

AIOps also correlates with information from other systems.
AIOps identifies any information that is
related to the situation ticket
and notifies the necessary people.
AIOps also identifies and suggests
for any similar historical tickets.
