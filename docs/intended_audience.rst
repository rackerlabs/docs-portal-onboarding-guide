This guide is intended for new Rackspace Technology customers who use
`the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <https://login.rackspace.com/login>`_
to manage their account. Some solutions, like ObjectRocket and Onica,
have their own portals and do not require access to
`The Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <https://login.rackspace.com/login>`_.
For more information
about these solutions, refer to the relevant documentation
on the `Rackspace Technology Support site <https://developer.rackspace.com/>`_.
