About Rackspace Technology billing
===================================

As a Rackspace Technology customer, you pay
for only the services that you use with one exception.
Your cloud servers and load balancers are billed
for uptime as long as they remain in the active
status, even if they are
not being used. These resources are allocated
for your exclusive use and cannot be reserved
by other customers.

Finally, Rackspace charges for only outbound
bandwidth, meaning that routine site maintenance,
such as content publishing and uploads,
does not affect your bandwidth allocation.

Your 30-day billing cycle begins on the day
that you activate your account, and your
bill reflects services used in the
previous month. If your usage begins
in the middle of a billing cycle, your
first bill reflects a partial month.

The **Billing** section displays the following
information:

- **Billing Overview**: Snapshot of balance,
  charges, transactions, and month-to-month trends.
- **Invoice Details**: Detailed printable view
  of your monthly invoices.
- **Charges to date**: Overview of all charges to date.
- **Payment Methods**: View and edit payment methods.
- **Make Payment**: Submit a payment.
- **Billing Settings**: Update your contact and
  invoice delivery information.
