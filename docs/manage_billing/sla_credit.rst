Request an SLA credit
=====================

Every Rackspace Technology product is backed by an
industry-leading service level agreement (SLA).
You can read this agreement at
`https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/sla <https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/sla>`_.
Use the following steps if you experience any issue
for which you want to receive an SLA credit.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To receive a credit, the SLA incident must meet
the following criteria:

    - The SLA incident must have occurred within the previous 30 days.
    - For specific concerns not mentioned in the SLA, the issue
      must have occurred within the previous 60 days.
    - Account balances must be current.
    - You must meet SLA requirements and obligations
      within the agreed-upon Terms of Service.
