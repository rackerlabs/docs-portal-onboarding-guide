title: Set a billing threshold
---

The **Set Billing Threshold** option enables you to receive a
notification when usage meets or exceeds an amount that you specify.
When this occurs, Rackspace emails the primary contact and the billing
contact.

To enable this functionality, use the following steps:

1.  Select **Set Billing Threshold** from the **Charges to Date**
    section. The **Billing Settings** page displays.
2.  Click the pencil icon next to **Threshold Notification**.
3.  Enter a monetary amount.
4.  Check the boxes next to the contacts who should receive the
    notifications and then select **Save**.
