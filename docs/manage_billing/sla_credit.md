title: Request an SLA credit
---

Every Rackspace Technology product is backed by an industry-leading
service level agreement (SLA). You can read this agreement at
<https://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/cloud/sla>. Use the
following steps if you experience any issue for which you want to
receive an SLA credit.

# Prerequisites

To receive a credit, the SLA incident must meet the following criteria:

> -   The SLA incident must have occurred within the previous 30 days.
> -   For specific concerns not mentioned in the SLA, the issue must
>     have occurred within the previous 60 days.
> -   Account balances must be current.
> -   You must meet SLA requirements and obligations within the
>     agreed-upon Terms of Service.

# Requesting an SLA credit

1.  Log in to the [Rackspace Technology Customer
    Portal](https://login.rackspace.com) .

#\. Create a support ticket and enter **Credit Request** in the
**Subject** field.

1.  Provide the following information in the support ticket:

    > -   Services affected
    > -   Summary of the incident
    > -   Date and time that the issue began
    > -   Date and time that the issue ended
    > -   Any associated correspondence relevant to the issue for which
    >     you want to receive credit such as logs, another ticket
    >     number, emails, or chats
    > -   Add any other pertinent details to credit consideration

2.  Select **Submit Ticket**.

Allow three to five business days for Rackspace Technology to receive
and review your credit request and update your support ticket.

# Issues not addressed by the SLA

If you experience technical issues not specifically addressed by your
product SLA, Rackspace Technology will still review your issue. You can
submit a ticket stating your case and why you believe you should get a
credit. Be sure to state how long you were affected and how you believe
Rackspace Technology was responsible.

Rackspace Technology does not issue a credit for cases in which the
Rackspace **Terms of Service** or **Acceptable Use Policy** are
violated.
