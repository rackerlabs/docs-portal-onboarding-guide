title: Reclaim VAT
---

If you\'re a VAT-registered business or organization, in most cases, you
can reclaim the value-added tax (VAT) that you pay when you buy goods
and services for your business. To reclaim this money, you must have
records to support your claim. If you provide Rackspace Technology with
your VAT ID number, Rackspace can prepare an appropriate invoice for
your records.

If you\'re not a VAT-registered business or organization, you can\'t
reclaim the VAT that you pay when you buy goods and services.
