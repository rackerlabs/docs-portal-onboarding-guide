title: Interpret a situation ticket
---

The following section explains how to interpret the three parts of a
situation ticket:

-   Subject line
-   Initial and additional comments
-   Ticket summary

# Subject line

When a situation ticket is generated or AIOps adds alerts to the
situation, the subject line dynamically updates to reflect the most
recent information. The following image shows the subject line of a
situation ticket:

The following table describes the parts of a situation ticket subject
line:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Section                             Description
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Situation number                    A unique situation number.

  Alert description                   The number of alerts associated
                                      with the situation ticket.

  Alert count                         The number of alerts associated
                                      with the situation ticket.

  Ticket number                       A unique ticket number.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Initial and additional comments

Situation tickets update when AIOps adds an alert to the situation. Each
update includes the new alert, a link to the situation, and the
Rackspace Notification System (RNS). The following image shows an
updated sample situation ticket:

The following table explains how to interpret a situation ticket.

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  A                                   Notifications Link: Shows the link
                                      to the notifications. Click the
                                      link to view the associated alerts
                                      on the **Notifications** page of
                                      the Rackspace Technology Customer
                                      Portal. **Important**: You do not
                                      see notifications for devices for
                                      which you do not have permissions.
                                      If you do not see any related
                                      notifications, review your device
                                      permissions. After you adjust the
                                      permissions, you will see alerts
                                      generated from that point forward.

  B                                   Situation Details: Shows the unique
                                      situation number, the Account
                                      Number associated with the
                                      situation, and the date and time
                                      the system generated the situation
                                      ticket.

  C                                   Clustered Alerts: Lists the alerts
                                      associated with the situation
                                      ticket.

# Ticket summary

When the support team clears a situation, the system updates the
situation ticket with summary information.

The summary includes all alerts associated with the ticket, including
any alerts that you did not previously receive because they were
initially internal to Rackspace Technology.

Refer to the following table to understand how to interpret a situation
ticket summary:

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  A                                   Situation Cleared: Identifies a
                                      resolved situation as

  B                                   Clustered Alerts: Lists the alerts
                                      associated with the situation

# Navigate to alerts in RNS

The Rackspace Notification System (RNS) contains all alerts associated
with a situation ticket. From within the ticket, you can navigate to the
**Notifications** page in the Rackspace Technology Customer Portal.

To navigate to the **Notifications** page, click the link in the ticket.

> ![\*\*situation tickets additional comments\*\*](/_images/rns.png)

RNS filters the **Notifications** page to include only the notifications
associated with the selected situation ticket. On the **Notifications**
page, you can perform the following actions:

-   Use the left panel to select the alert you want to view.

-   Use the right panel to see the alert message, view its details, and
    see the associated device.

-   Click **Actions** to reply to the ticket or modify preferences so
    that you do not receive notification emails for each alert posted to
    the **Notifications** page.

    ![\*\*situation tickets additional comments\*\*](/_images/rns2.png)

# Notification emails

By default, the notification system sends you an email for each alert
associated with a situation ticket. This default setting means that you
receive an email for each situation ticket and all associated alerts. To
receive emails for only the situation ticket, refer to **Configure
notification email preferences**.

> ![\*\*situation tickets additional comments\*\*](/_images/situation_email.png)

# Configure notification email preferences

By default, you receive an email for a situation ticket and associated
alert notifications. This setting can produce many emails. For example,
when a server goes down, you receive a ticket email and separate alert
notification emails informing you of insufficient memory, unavailable
ApacheÂ® service, and a Secure Shell (SSH) error.

You can modify notification preferences to reduce the number of emails
you receive. You can turn off email notifications globally for all
devices or select the devices for which you do not want to receive email
notifications.

::: note

Note

When you turn off email notifications, either globally or for specific
devices, you do not receive any notification emails, including warning
notifications that are not associated with a situation ticket.
:::

For example, consider a disk usage scenario where the monitoring system
generates a warning alert at 75% usage and an error alert at 90% usage.
In this scenario, RNS displays the 75% warning alert but does not
generate a ticket. When disk usage exceeds 90%, the monitoring system
generates a ticket.
