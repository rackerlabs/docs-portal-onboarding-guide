title: Situation tickets
---

In addition to manual tickets that you and the Rackspace Technology
support team generated, there are also system-generated tickets, known
as situation tickets.

Rackspace Technology uses artificial intelligence to help streamline how
your notifications work. In this process, an AIOps integration maps the
event properties to the AIOps data fields and identifies the source
event as an AIOps event. These events are grouped into a single alert
called a *situation*. This technology collects events as raw data and
uses machine learning to group them based on similarity into situation
tickets.

AIOps groups events by using machine learning algorithms, based on their
similarities.

Alerts can be grouped or clustered in several different ways, including:

-   by arrival time
-   by the time, text string, or description
-   by a deterministic logic set up by your administrator

AIOps also correlates with information from other systems. AIOps
identifies any information that is related to the situation ticket and
notifies the necessary people. AIOps also identifies and suggests for
any similar historical tickets.
