Rackspace Technology Private Cloud customers can use templates to create
tickets for common issues quickly. Ticket templates help you reduce
costs by enabling automations for frequent ticket requests. They make it
easy for you to establish a repeatable and scalable process.

Ticket templates also help Rackspace Technology Support respond to your
requests quickly.
